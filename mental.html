            <p>A very concerning issue comes from the mental perspective. As a college student, I am a
                victim to college playing a part in mental degradation. However, it is not just me who is
                struggling with these issues, essentially all students have experienced at least one of these issues.
                According to a survey conducted by Healthy Minds Network, over 77% of college students have
                gone through a mental illness (The Healthy Minds Study, 2023). This is an overwhelmingly high
                percentage, and it should spark concern. A common cause for this is academic rigor. Personally, I
                have experienced many nights where the workload feels unbearable which causes me to go
                through anxiety and burnout. However, I had many peers experience similar symptoms as well
                overall worsening their mental health.

            A big problem is that this issue is already well known to students and faculty, but not
            enough is being done to address this problem. A research journal from the National Library of
            medicine says, “Although many colleges and universities are aware of the significant mental
            health needs among their students, the mental health and psychosocial needs of students often
            exceed the availability of resources and cultural and contextual barriers, such as stigma, may
            further impede access to care.” (Brown et al., 2023). It shows that universities aren’t putting
            enough effort to help resolve these issues. For example, RIT’s health center is known to have
            notorious customer service. Being closed on weekends limits access for students seeking care,
            especially when the weekend is the only time when students don’t have class. There are also
            many instances where appointments could only be scheduled weeks or even months in advance.
            Universities having inadequate service can easily be dealt with by putting more time and money
            into this system.
