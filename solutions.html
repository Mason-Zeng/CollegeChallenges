                Addressing the challenges faced by university students requires a multifaceted approach that 
                encompasses mental, physical, and financial well-being. One potential solution is to prioritize 
                and invest in comprehensive mental health services on campus. This includes increasing the availability 
                of counseling and therapy sessions, hiring more mental health professionals, and implementing proactive 
                mental health education and support programs. By destigmatizing mental health issues and providing 
                accessible and timely care, universities can better support students in managing stress, anxiety, 
                and other mental health concerns. Additionally, fostering a supportive and inclusive campus culture 
                where students feel comfortable seeking help and discussing their mental health struggles can contribute 
                to overall well-being.

            </figure>
            <p>
                On the physical perspective, universities can implement initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles and 
                encourage physical activity among students. This may involve offering free or discounted gym memberships, 
                organizing fitness classes and recreational activities, and providing resources on nutrition and healthy 
                living. Creating environments that prioritize physical well-being, such as bike-friendly campuses and 
                accessible green spaces, can also encourage students to adopt healthier habits. Furthermore, raising 
                awareness about the negative effects of substance use and providing resources for substance abuse 
                prevention and intervention can help mitigate the risks associated with unhealthy behaviors.

            <p>
                From a financial perspective, universities can explore strategies to alleviate the financial burden 
                on students and make higher education more accessible. This may include increasing financial aid and 
                scholarship opportunities, freezing or reducing tuition rates, and implementing cost-saving measures
                for textbooks and other educational materials. Providing financial literacy education and resources 
                to help students manage their finances effectively can also empower them to make informed decisions 
                and avoid excessive debt. Additionally, universities can prioritize transparency and accountability 
                in their financial practices to ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and equitably. By 
                addressing the root causes of financial stress and promoting financial stability, universities can 
                support students in achieving their academic and personal goals without being unduly burdened by 
                financial concerns.
