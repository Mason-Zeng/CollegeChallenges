            <p> Mental health issues are not the only issues that students face. Physical health is also
                affected. A core cause of this problem results is the fact that college students have more freedom
                and usually make decisions on their own. This could shed a positive light as a student may
                decide to use the university's recreational center to better their physical health. However, a
                student could also make unideal decisions and negatively impact their physical health. In an
                article from the organization, WalkItScience, it says, “During college years, students become
                more sedentary and as their physical activities decrease, their Body Mass Index and weight
                increases. It's a gradual process, students come out of college significantly less active and
                heavier compared to when they started their freshman year” (WalkItScience). In most cases,
                students unfortunately pick the less ideal choice which leads to more sedentary lifestyles making
                them prone to health diseases such as diabetes. Like the causes of mental health issues, having a
                greater workload results in a less active lifestyle which is unhealthy. The stress from the
                workload also weakens the immune system making our bodies prone to health diseases.

        <p> Another consequence of the results of poor decision making is the introduction to
            substance use. According to this research journal regarding the “day in the life of college
            students”, it says, “More than one-third of full-time college students aged 18 to 22 engaged in
            binge drinking in the past month; about 1 in 5 used an illicit drug in the past month.” (Lipari &
            Jean-Francois, 2016). Utilizing substances is a major detriment to the physical health of students
            as it damages major organs. Being under the influence of these substances makes students prone
            to reckless behavior which could further injure their bodies as well.
