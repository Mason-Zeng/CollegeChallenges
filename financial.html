            <p> Another common issue regarding college comes from finances. The main perpetrator is
                the tuition, which in many cases has been a financial burden to the students and their families.
                An article from U.S. News and World Report states that within the last 20 years, college tuition
                for private universities has increased by 40% (Kerr & Wood, 2023). This isn't just for private
                universities but there is a significant upcharge in tuition for public institutions as well. As a
                result, many students must take loans or even work multiple jobs to afford their education. In
                many cases, this leads to substantial debt burdens which can last multiple years.

        </div>
        <p> Tuition isn't the only factor in financial troubles. There are other finances such as room
            and board, meal plans, and even textbooks. This is a problem because these financial issues can
            cause the physical and mental health issues that were stated previously. Everyone agrees that
            college is unfairly overpriced due to institutions mainly focusing on profit rather than the values
            of education.
